# Player Collars

Lets players wear pet collars. See branches for possible versions. Some pre-compiled versions are available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/leashable-collars).

This mod requires [Curios](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) under Forge and [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) under fabric or [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories) for 1.21.4.

## Usage

When crafted, collars are red. They can be dyed similar to leather armor. Alternatively, shift right click (while holding the collar) to edit the colors manually. This menu also allows editing of the paw color (blue by default) and setting the collar's owner.

### Owner mechanics

Collars can have an "owner", the presence of which will affect the wearer of the collar. Owners can use leads to move the wearer of the collar. Some enchantments will provide additional effects.

### Enchantments

- Healing: Wearer will recieve Regeneration when within 16 blocks of the owner.
- Tight Leash: Wearer will be pulled closer to the owner when a lead is used. Default follow distance is 4 blocks, each level of Loyalty reduces this by 1 to a minimum of 2 blocks.
- Spiked: Works like Thorns, but with no durability penalty.

To add an enchantment to a collar, first enchant a book and then add the enchantment in an anvil.

### Clickers

If an owner uses a clicker, nearby owned players will be forced to look at the owner. The radius is determined by the level of Audible the clicker is enchanted with.

To add audible to a clicker, enchant a book with audible and add the enchantment in an avil!

Clickers can be dyed in the same manner as leather armor.
