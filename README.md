# Player Collars

Lets players wear pet collars. See branches for possible versions. Some pre-compiled versions are available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/leashable-collars).

This mod requires [Curios](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) under Forge and [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) under fabric or [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories) for 1.21.4.

## Usage

Recipe is
```
 L 
LIL
 D 
```

where L is leather, I is a gold ingot, and D is a dye.

When crafted, collars are red. They can be dyed similar to leather armor. Alternatively, shift right click to edit the colors manually. This menu also allows editing of the paw color (blue by default) and setting the collar's owner.

### Owner mechanics

Collars can have an "owner", the presence of which will affect the wearer of the collar. Owners can use leads to move the wearer of the collar. Some enchantments will provide additional effects.

### Enchantments

- Healing: Wearer will recieve Regeneration when within 16 blocks of the owner.
- Tight Leash: Wearer will be pulled closer to the owner when a lead is used. Default follow distance is 4 blocks, each level of Loyalty reduces this by 1 to a minimum of 2 blocks.
- Spiked: Works like Thorns, but with no durability penalty.

### Clickers

...
```
 # 
OIO
 O
```

where `#` is a button, `O` is planks, and `I` is an iron ingot.

If an owner uses a clicker, nearby owned players will be forced to look at the owner. The radius is determined by the level of Audible the clicker is enchanted with.

Clickers can be dyed in the same manner as leather armor.
